He felt betrayed and cheated, as if the whole world had singled him out for misery. Once adored and cherished, he was now ignored and discarded like he never mattered. The dejected, crestfallen look in his eyes told a story of being victimized by those he trusted. He was anxious, constantly worried and fearful of what might come next. Memories that were once blissful and bright had turned gloomy and dreary, leaving him powerless and defeated. Even when he tried to appear calm, his heart felt heavyhearted, his mind confused, and his soul tortured. He longed to feel appreciated and valued again, to escape the sad, lonely silence that surrounded him.
